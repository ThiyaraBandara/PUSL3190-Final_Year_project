## Understanding Results

The system analyzes URLs and provides a phishing score based on various factors:

- **PHISHING** (Score 70+): High risk, likely a phishing site
- **MAYBE PHISHING** (Score 31-69): Medium risk, suspicious characteristics
- **NOT PHISHING** (Score 0-30): Low risk, appears legitimate
